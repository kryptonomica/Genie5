# AI Advisor (planned)

> 🚧 **Roadmap / not enabled.** Genie 5 includes the scaffolding for an optional AI assistant, but it is **feature-flagged off** and makes **no external calls** in current builds. This page describes the design and — most importantly — the guarantees it must meet before any part of it ships on by default.

## What it is meant to be

An **advisor**, not an autopilot. The intended modes, in priority order:

1. **Parser assistance** — spotting unfamiliar game output and helping extend the parser (a development aid).
2. **Gameplay insight** — summarizing what's happening and surfacing suggestions in a panel you read.
3. **In-character advisor** — optional roleplay phrasing help (the most sensitive mode; see below).

In every case the output is **text you read and decide to act on**. It never types for you.

## The hard line: advisor-only, never agentive

The single most important rule: the AI **must not drive the game**. It does not call the command pipeline directly or by any indirect path. AI output is displayed; you choose what, if anything, to type. This is enforced as a release gate, and any change that wires AI output back into the command pipeline is rejected. See [Policy Compliance](Policy-Compliance) — agentive AI is one of the project's hard "nevers."

## How it's isolated

The AI path hangs off a **separate, toggleable branch** of the raw game stream. It can be turned on or off without touching the parser, and a slow response can never block the game loop — analysis runs fully asynchronously. A rolling context buffer feeds an external AI service only when you've explicitly enabled it.

```
raw game stream
  ├─► parser ─► game state / scripts / UI   (always on, never blocked)
  └─► AI branch (off by default) ─► context buffer ─► external AI service ─► suggestion panel
```

## Privacy guarantees (the release gates)

Before any external send is enabled by default, the design requires all of these:

- **Default OFF, opt-in.** A checkbox in Settings, behind a plain-language privacy disclosure.
- **Other players' words are stripped first.** Before anything is sent to an external service, the context buffer removes other players' utterances — whispers, speech, thoughts, familiar/group chatter, and tells. Those are content other players never consented to have forwarded.
- **In-character mode stays off** entirely until there's an explicit read of the relevant terms around player-generated content.

Your local **session recordings** (from **File → Record Session**) are a separate thing: they're written only to your machine and never leave it.

## Why so cautious

DragonRealms is a shared, social game with its own software policy, and other players' words aren't ours to ship to a third party. The conservative posture — off by default, opt-in, other-player content stripped, never agentive — is what lets an assistant exist at all without crossing those lines. The same reasoning runs through the rest of the client; see [Policy Compliance](Policy-Compliance).
