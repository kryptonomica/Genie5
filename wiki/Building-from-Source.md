# Building from Source

For contributors and the curious. End users only need [Installation](Installation); this page covers the project layout, the developer test harness, and where the engineering docs live. The canonical contributor guide is [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites

- **[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)** (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- A DragonRealms account if you want to test against a live server (free trial accounts work for most testing).

## Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5.git
cd Genie5
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/Genie.App
```

See [Architecture](Architecture) for why `Genie.Core` is kept UI-free.

## The dev test harness (Console)

`Genie.Core` builds as an executable so a headless **Console** harness can drive the engine without the GUI — invaluable for parser work. Run modes:

```bash
# Live session, capturing raw XML to test_results/
dotnet run --project src/Genie.Core -- DR <account> <password> <char>

# Replay a recording through the parser stack (speed: 0=max, 1.0=real-time, 5.0=5x)
dotnet run --project src/Genie.Core -- REPLAY <file> [speed]

# Diff parser output vs a tag-stripped baseline from the same recording
dotnet run --project src/Genie.Core -- COMPARE <file>

# List characters on an account without logging in
dotnet run --project src/Genie.Core -- LIST <account> <password>
```

Test-harness output lands in `test_results/` (gitignored — your captures stay local).

### Terminology: Live session / Recording / Replay

To keep these straight:

- **Live session** — a real socket open to `play.net` (or a Lich proxy), created by the **App** or the **Console**.
- **Recording** — the `.xml` file capturing a live session's raw byte stream (App: `Logs/`; Console: `test_results/`).
- **Replay** — running a recording back through the engine. It **only reads, never writes** — it cannot touch a live server.

(There is no in-App replay viewer yet; use the Console for replay.)

## Compatibility constraints (please respect)

Non-negotiable for any PR touching the relevant subsystem:

1. **`.cmd` script parity** — the engine must remain a faithful port of Genie 4's interpreter. Test against the [DR-Genie-Scripts](https://github.com/Tirost/DR-Genie-Scripts) collection.
2. **Map data format** — Genie 4 zone XML must round-trip without loss (24+ community forks depend on it).
3. **SGE protocol** — don't change handshake logic without verifying against the [Genie 4 source](https://github.com/GenieClient); small mistakes silently break auth.
4. **DragonRealms policy** — the hard "nevers" in [Policy Compliance](Policy-Compliance) will close a PR that introduces them.

## Contributing workflow

Open an issue first for anything non-trivial, branch from `main`, keep PRs focused, include a test plan, and update docs in the same PR. Full details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie5/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
